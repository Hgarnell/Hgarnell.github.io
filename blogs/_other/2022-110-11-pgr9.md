proposal Summary

Assuming that affects (primary, instinctual emotions) are central to an understanding of phenomenal consciousness, this thesis proposal sheds light on general artificial intelligence and explains the "hard problem"[1] (subjective conscious experience) by modelling a neuronal circuit of the seek affect (see glossary) within the central complex of _Drosophila melanogaster_. The easy problems of consciousness  is explainable using standard methodologies of cognitive science (i.e. vision, motor responses, hearing, etc.), whereby the phenomenon of innate subjective experience, the hard problem, still poses many explanatory gaps.

The proposal hypothesizes that the ‘seek affect’ (one of seven known affects) are the root of phenomenal consciousness, and that by employing three domains of methodologies (mathamatics, neurophysiology, and computational affective neuroscience) it is possible to localize and model a neuromechanistic explanations of seek. The seeking system is the system that the proposal will focus on because, as Panksepp proposes[2], it makes up a foundational layer of consciousness apart from other affects.

Research Questions- text

1. Where exactly is Seek located?

2. What kind of circuits might seek look like?

3. What is the behavior of seek from a neurophysiological perspective?

The importance of this research is, central to man's understanding of a longstanding enigma: What is the cause of a living creature's subjective experience in the world? Moreover, if my thesis can at some point help provide objective results that shed light upon the true nature of affective states, and by association, phenomenal consciousness, it would be a significant first step towards a comprehensive explanation of phenomenal consciousness.

**Research Design** **_-_** Broken into three domains, the proposal is grounded in priors and methodologies from Mathematics, Neurophysiology, and Computational Affective Neuroscience.

Central to the proposal will be the use of the FlybrainLab, a software platform that will make possible the following:

1.       Mapping of known neurophysiological pathways within the central complex of Drosophila.

2.       Algorithmic (i.e., Louvain) community detection of neural correlates to determine the structure and location of the seeking system.

3.       Neurophysiological modelling of candidate circuits and activity maps within Drosophila

4.       Simulation of seeking functionality using sample spike chain input

5.       **Optional**: Comparison of simulated neural correlates to actual Patch Clamp Local Field Potential (pcLFP) recordings made by other research groups.

**Data Collection and Analysis** – Modelling of neuronal circuits within FlybrainLab is the primary analytical method employed by the proposal. Once candidate circuits are mapped, it is possible to make functional simulations and make comparisons to patch clamp local field potential recordings (pcLFP, see glossary for more details). The proposal's goal is not to generate pcLFP data, as it requires very specialized equipment and labs set up for biological research. Instead, it is proposed to leverage the output of various laboratories to help construct a surrogate model of the seek system in _Drosophila_. In effect, this is where we model and localize "what" the seek neural correlate is and then explore "how" such a model works from a functional perspective.

**Working Title**

Exploring Affects Within Drosophila’s Central Complex Using Computational Affective Neuroscience

**Research Question(s)**

What is the cause of a living creature's subjective experience in the world? This question has perplexed humanity and is arguably the most significant challenge researchers face. The search for general artificial intelligence and an explanation for the "hard problem" of consciousness is a topic of great importance within information technology, cognitive neuroscience, and philosophy[1]. However, there is much debate on what exactly drives general intelligence, assuming it is a system that supervenes neurophysiological processes within the brain.

**Hypothesis** - The proposal attempts to demonstrate that affects such as “seek” are the root of phenomenal consciousness and will employ a novel framework to locate and test candidate neural circuits within the central complex of _Drosophila melanogaster_. To this end, the proposal puts forth a hypothesis: that specific affects (proto-feelings such as “seek”) reside within an identifiable neuronal circuit of an insects brain’s central complex.

Understanding why affects within insects represent an objective account for affects and phenomenal consciousness takes some explaining. Employing a novel framework, made up of three technical domains along with their associated research methods, will provide a sufficient explanation. Furthermore, because the Hard Problem has many aspects which are difficult to define, let alone explain using constructs based on neuroscience, the proposal explores a well-defined hypothesis that explores a source of consciousness within a simple model organism. Namely, the existence of affects within _Drosophila_. This is done for good reason. As Vilas points out, addressing phenomenal consciousness leads to explananda that lack unity and provide only a vague understanding of what exactly needs to be explained[3]. This general issue is referred to as the Explananda Problem. Therefore, the general question of what manifests phenomenal consciousness in complex organisms (i.e. humans) shall remain outside the proposal. Within the proposal, a narrower, if not more reasonable, working hypothesis is raised to explore how consciousness might work in animals such as the fruit fly, _Drosophila melanogaster_.

Animal models such as _Drosophila_ are well suited for exploring the hard problem for two basic reasons. Firstly, the brain of Drosophila contains fewer neurons than most other animal models. For example, the fruit fly has roughly two hundred and fifty thousand neurons compared to humans, which have billions. Secondly, numerous well-established research methodologies can be leveraged since many researchers have heavily studied _Drosophila_. Moreover, software platforms such as the Fruit Fly Brain Observatory (FFBO) have allowed for (relatively) more straightforward ways to explore both the connectome and synaptome of _Drosophila_.

**Rationale and Significance of the Study**

There has been much progress in computer science to address _the hard problem of consciousness_ as defined by Chalmers[4]. It’s fair to say that there’s been good progress using deep learning and neural networks to address some aspects of AI. Examples of this are seen in the computer’s ability to play games like chess and go. However, it must be understood that even with all such progress to date, Artificial General Intelligence, like we have in living organisms with a brain, has not been achieved[5]. In fact, current research has no immediate way to achieve AGI in the near future using standard approaches using either classical AI or newer techniques in deep learning[5]. It would seem that we lack a correct understanding of the problem at hand, often made more difficult by the many aspects of consciousness that must be explained. These things that need to be explained are referred to as explananda leading to an explanatory gap. The proposal does not intend to make a breakthrough discovery that brings all matters to rest, only to shed light on the topic by focusing the best technology on the simplest meaningful example of biological _affective systems_. By doing so, it is hoped that successful findings would usher in a new era for Cognitive Neuroscience and the AI. It may be somewhat difficult to imagine a world where robotic systems and computer systems possess some level of intelligence that rivals human intelligence. And this would not be mere simulation, but a true homologue of first-person subjective experience in some form. Such systems would have immediate effects on any number of industries: High Tech, Education, healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation are just a start. Our legal systems may also need to expand to include artificial organisms that would be sentient creatures, not unlike the animals and humans. Of course, such changes won’t happen overnight. Like the discovery of electricity, full integration of affective neuroscience would take decades as the world catches up with a new reality.

**Literature/Past Research Review**

Consciousness is both a psychological property (functional) and a phenomenal property that reveals what it's like to be in a particular mental state. These two forms of consciousness, psychological and phenomenal, are crucial to a holistic understanding of consciousness. Not because consciousness is some metaphysical property, but because it indicates that sensory experiences such as sight, sound, touch, etc., are psychological properties distinctly separate from emotions, affects, and the feeling of self. If one bifurcates consciousness in this manner, it follows that there are two systems at work. This notion is supported by neuroscience. For example, the work of Mark Solms using Neuropsychoanalysis has demonstrated experimentally that cortical consciousness supervenes upon affective feelings in the subcortex region called the Extended Reticulothalamic Activating System (ERTAS) [6]. Damasio also uses neurobiology to explore cellular correlations of feelings and has argued that feelings and affective states within brainstem components overlap with the ERTAS [7]. Panksepp, using affective neuroscience, has a similar view[8]. He demonstrates that all vertebrates share homologous, subcortical brain functions that engender unconditioned instinctual emotions (analogous to affects). Considering all these ideas and methodologies, the notion of two systems should be explored with neurobiological evidence to help support an objective definition.

With a highlighted focus on feelings as a central component of the conscious experience, it is necessary to understand the sub-structure that drives emotions. Panksepp's research and nomenclature of primary emotions are foundational to this understanding. According to Panksepp, there are seven distinct primary emotional systems: seek, joy, rage, lust, care, grief/panic, and fear. Of these, the seeking system is the system that the proposal will focus on. This is because the seek system makes up a foundational layer of consciousness apart from other affects [2]. According to Panksepp, the seek affective system operates continuously in the background as a general-purpose system for engaging with the environment. Further, he shows how the "seek" affects in animal species participate in a wide range of behaviours and act as a central driver of consciousness[9]. To put the meaning of all this in more precise terms, the seek affect in animals acts to drive biological creatures to a) behave as agents in the environment by b) bringing attention to some stimulus that presents itself, and c) stimulate further actions that help resolve homeostatic drives presented by an animal's biological system.

The existence of seek affects and their mechanics are central to the proposal and cannot be understated. And while the seek affect in humans may drive a wide range of complex behaviours, this proposal is not concerned with higher-level neocortex emotions and associated psychological states. Instead, the presumption is simply that affects are the most fundamental states that manifest complex emotions via interaction between the neocortex and the brainstem.

With a prior based on the fundamental role of affects, it is important to reiterate Vilas’ Explananda Problem. points out, addressing phenomenal consciousness leads to explananda that lack unity and provide only a vague understanding of what exactly needs to be explained[3]. This general issue is referred to as the Explananda Problem. Therefore, the general question of what manifests phenomenal consciousness in complex organisms shall remain outside the proposal.

From a mathematical perspective, there are several theories (frameworks) on how to explain the 'brain's ability to function. A standard mathematical approach is equations that explain neuronal dynamics such as the Leaky Integrate and Fire model[10]. It is commonly used to explain how information in the form of action potentials (electrical pulses or spikes) propagate along chains of neurons. This model is just an approximation but is often used to calculate complex simulations of neuronal circuits. Details of this can be found in Appendix 1.

A more detailed model showing how action potentials are generated by ion channels is the Hodgkin-Huxley model[11]. It demonstrates how electrical signals propagate by electrical currents that pass through a rich set of ion channels in neuronal cell membranes. Hodgkin-Huxley models can account for the many different synapse types that exist within the brain.

Moving to a higher level of abstraction is the Free-Energy Principle (FEP), which does not try to explain neuronal dynamics at the cellular level, but instead, explores conscious behaviour based on Bayesian principles. Originally put forth by Friston, FEP is a mathematical model that demonstrates how biological agents retain their homeostatic equilibrium against the entropy of nature[12]. Or, in simpler terms, how organisms resist their dangerous environments. While FEP is a very interesting and potentially viable model for future study, it will not be explored by the proposal due to constraints of both time and scope.

Finally, an important theory put forth by Tononi is Integrated Information Theory (IIT) which has garnered much interest in the scientific community. In essence, the theory proposes that consciousness is dependent on the degree of Integration of information via interactions within an entire system and represents more information than the sum of its individual components[13]. According to IIT, consciousness is intrinsic to a 'system's ability to integrate information based on two phenomenological properties: 'Differentiation,' which is the availability of many conscious states; and 'Integration,' the ability to unify states into an experience[14]. Furthermore, IIT claims that the degree of consciousness can be mathematically calculated based on the informational relationships among complexes within a conscious system. However, while IIT is quite intriguing, it has raised much criticism. First, it does not attempt to demonstrate consciousness based on causality; instead, it postulates that consciousness is an intrinsic property of integrated information; and secondly, it is practically infeasible to compute[15]. I will not delve into a critique of IIT as the proposal will not employ it.

The above represents a subset of ideas and research methods used to pursue consciousness. And while it is difficult to review all methodologies in detail, taking the whole field into account, the Hard Problem has been pursued using philosophy, physics, mathematics, computer science, neurophysiology, and psychology. This is not an exhaustive list, but it does demonstrate that a wide diversity of research methodologies have been applied to this topic. This proposal will use a particular set of research methodologies. Namely: mathematics, neurophysiology (within _Drosophila_), and computational biology (using circuit simulations of the FFBO). Combining these three research methodologies into a single proposal that is reasonably implementable for a single researcher or a small team.

**Design of the Study**

The creation of non-biological models that simulate affects can be subject to various interpretations. When looking at any aspect of consciousness, the nature of the problem and any answers can be the source of great confusion. This is presumably due to multilayers of complexity and emergent properties addressing these issues. This proposal will use a synthesis of interdisciplinary knowledge across three domains: _mathematics_, _neurophysiology, and computational affective neuroscience._

However, explaining the detailed scientific methodologies of each domain can be somewhat complex and difficult to comprehend if one is new to this field. To address this complexity and make things easier to grasp at a high level, a mind-map diagram is included below in Figure 1 along with an associated PDF that can be used to examine details by zooming into the diagram. Design methods will be discussed below using the mind-map with technical details included in associated appendixes.

**Figure 1** – A Mind-map overview showing the scientific problem at the centre with outward layers demonstrating theories and methodologies explored by the proposal. Note that while not precise, the size of the circles tends to emphasize importance to the overall thesis along with bolder colours that emphasize favoured theories and methodologies. A PDF of the same document is also provided to make zooming into the details possible.

The above mind map begins with the scientific problem being addressed at a high level. In this case: Seek affects as the foundation of consciousness. It is a conundrum, and this form of the problem is vague and rife with fractured theories and ideas. The real question to be addressed is more formal within the framework of computational affective neuroscience, but let’s refrain from diving in too quickly. To understand the theories and associated design methodologies in support of the proposal, we begin with a very basic form of the problem and then look at supporting theories and methodologies as we move further to the outside rings of the diagram. By doing so, it is the goal of the mind-map to address Vilas’ Explananda Problem (aspects of the problem that require explaining) and help justify the search for affects within an insect’s central complex. Thus, we begin with the first layer that consolidates the explananda problem into four major groups (the four directions of the mind-map):

1.       What is consciousness?

2.       What are the characteristics of consciousness?

3.       How does consciousness work?

4.       Where is seek located in the brain?

**What is consciousness?**

Much has been theorized over the last few decades, but many notions are grouped under an umbrella theory called, “Theory of Mind”. And while it is possible to fill entire books about this branch of theories, the proposal highlights two central theoretical branches: Cognitive and Phenomenological consciousness. Of the two, Cognitive theory deals with what Chalmers calls, “the easy problem”. This refers to a modern understanding of how incoming sensory information travels through the central nervous system and an organism’s ability to respond. For example, consider how light travels through the eyes and into the retina and then through the nervous system to be interpreted by the visual cortex. While the mechanical process for sight is by no means easy to explain, it is explainable using well established scientific methods. The ability to explain such mechanistic processes is precisely why Chalmers refers to this as the “Easy Problem”.

The more interesting theory here is Phenomenology. Once again, there are countless books on the subject[9, 16-18], but to sum things in short, Phenomenology attempts to explain the phenomena known as consciousness. This is an obtuse definition but to boil things down further, one can consider Phenomenology as method of exploring the subjective experience. Why is this important? We may be familiar with our general understanding of feelings and our own personal subjective experience, but in scientific terms it seems almost incomprehensible to consider how a biological process can give rise to the subjective experience. There remains a large explanatory gap and this is precisely why Chalmers calls all this “the hard problem”

But Chalmers is only one of many who’ve tried to tackle all this. Heidegger was central to the exploration of Phenomenology as a branch of Intentionalism[18]. And by applying his ontology, it might be possible to argue how affects within the brain represent a conscious phenomenon, and by doing so, give rise to an organism’s subjective experience. This thought should simply be kept in the back of one’s mind as other research methodologies are explored. Philosophy is indeed useful describing the problem to be solved, but it won’t suffice to employ any philosophy that escapes empirical falsification. Thus, the proposal will utilize the questions raised by philosophy, but not seek answers in this domain. Instead move to other domains that provide modern objective scientific methodologies that can be used to test the above hypothesis.

Before moving on, note that there is no discussion yet of some theories in this lower section of the mind-map. Namely: Epistemology, Realism, Instrumentalism and Scientific Reductionism. These will be discussed later as their import is more understandable in relation to other areas of the mind-map.

**What are the characteristics of consciousness?**

The next aspect of the explananda problem is the characteristics of consciousness. This domain is heavily influenced by theories that, at a high level, try to characterise consciousness by the properties it exhibits. In the mind-map (left side) we show several ideas that are popular amongst the scientific community. From a theoretical perspective, they can be grouped into three domains: Electro-Magnetic; Algebraic; and Bayesian. A brief comment on each follows here.

Electro-Magnetic – This group of theories and methodologies is associated with quantum effects as the cause of consciousness within the brain. Namely, it is not neuronal dynamics that drive consciousness, but quantum behaviours (i.e. quantum wave collapse) within the microtubules within and across groups of brain cells. These arguments have been made by Hameroff, Penrose (Noble Prize winner) and Chalmers. While no doubt an intriguing hypothesis, there is a great deal of controversy regarding the evidence to support this line of thinking[19]. Further, it is doubted that quantum effects across groups of brain cells are even possible and that this theoretical model is mere hypothetical speculation. Because of the many criticisms, the proposal will not consider this a viable methodology until more evidence comes to light.

Algebraic – This is a group of theories associated with Integrated Information Theory (IIT) proposed by Tononi. As already stated above, IIT posits that consciousness is intrinsic to a 'system's ability to integrate information based on two phenomenological properties: 'Differentiation,' which is the availability of many conscious states; and 'Integration,' the ability to unify states into an experience[14]. A central tenet of IIT is that the degree of consciousness can be measured using an algebraic algorithm which results in a value named Phi ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image006.gif). However, while in theory, it is possible to mathematically calculate ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image008.gif), it is in practice intractable to calculate for anything other than the most simple example[15]. That is not the only problem. There is also no mechanical explanation for consciousness other than to say it is intrinsically associated with integrated informational systems. That integrated information just “is” consciousness, does not sit well with many scientists[15].

Thus, the proposal will not consider IIT a viable methodology due to 1) it's lack of a mechanistic explanation for consciousness and 2) its central tenet being diametrically opposed to the hypothesis proposed here. Again, the hypothesis here proposes that consciousness is created by specific “affective” neural circuits, and this entails that consciousness is necessarily located in a specific location within the brain. IIT does not, as a theory, take this point of view.

Bayesian – These are theories associated with the brain’s characteristics as a biological machine demonstrating the principles of Bayesian probability. Under this general umbrella, a framework called the Free Energy Principle (FEP) is gaining traction in the scientific community as a satisfactory model explaining how conscious organisms respond to stimuli in the environment. Originally put forth by Friston, FEP is a mathematical model that demonstrates how biological agents retain their homeostatic equilibrium against the entropy of nature[12]. Or, in simpler terms, how organisms resist their (often) dangerous environments. Models based on a foundation of Bayesian Inference do offer an intriguing approach to studying phenomenal consciousness. It is hypothesized that the brain can be considered an Empirical Bayes model of sensory information to dynamically construct expectations of the external world that, in turn, formulate optimally beneficial behaviours and responses.

Although this theory offers an interesting explanation of consciousness, it is essential to realize that these methods only provide an instrumentalist's view of the problem. Here we digress momentarily to highlight Instrumentalism that was in the lower left section of the mind-map. Instrumentalism was not discussed yet because its importance becomes more significant here. It’s a philosophy of science that positions a theory as useful to explain and predict a phenomenon. Using Instrumentalism, one should not see FEP explaining what is mechanically happening within the brain. Instead, these models guide and help characterize the neural circuits of interest.

FEP and the Bayesian model offer some attractive possibilities. For instance, one could test FEP by using local field potential (LFP) recordings of particular neurons in the brains and determine if they exhibit the minimization of free energy as predicted by FEP. See Appendices 2 and 3 for more details on the methodologies that could support such a test. However, at this time there is one major problem with this notion. While it’s easy enough to record input and output neurons of _Drosophila_ (i.e. the medulla (MED) as input and ventral nerve cord (VNC) as output), neurons with these tasks and functions are well understood from a cognitive perspective. Refer to Appendix 2 for more details about the relation of neurophysiological structures. But the neuronal circuits that represent seek affects are currently unknown. At best, the whole concept of affective neurons seems to be considered a form of pre-motor functionality (see Shih’s diagram in Appendix 2 for an example).  Pre-motor in this case is nothing more than a logical black box that researches refer to as logic taking place before motor neurons send out signals for action. But I believe this is a misunderstanding. Pre-Motor in this case is sub-cortex affects working out a behaviour that will lead to homeostatic balance. Based on the theories of affect localization in the mid-brain proposed by Panksepp and Solms[20], we can predict that such affective circuits will reside within the central complex (i.e. sub-cortex) region of an invertebrate such as _Drosophila melanogaster_. Sadly, the central complex (CX) is still a dense cluster (rich club) of neurons, and it would be an unsatisfactory explanation to consider the entire CX as a general representation of affects. Locating and mapping out candidate affective circuits is a necessary first step. However, such an endeavour cannot be accomplished with instrumentalist methodologies. Instead, the proposal concentrates early research on those methodologies that can provide a more realistic understanding of a neural correlate of affects. With that in mind, we can move on to the next area of the mind-map:  How consciousness works and associated theories within Physicalism (Mind-Brain Identity theory) and Neurophysiology.

**How does consciousness work?**

As we now explore the right side of the mind-map and attempt to explain “how” consciousness might work, it is an appropriate time to digress back to the philosophical section of the mind-map and review Realism, a philosophical theory that claims that things are real and exist, irrespective of what anyone may think or say. Realism and its offshoot, Scientific Reductionism, are closely related to Physicalism on the right side of the map. Together, these theories as a group reject Dualism and the idea that the mind is a non-physical phenomenon and does not supervene the existence of a brain.

The proposal rejects all forms of dualism, and this includes Chalmer’s modern theories of psycho-physical explanations for phenomenal consciousness. However, even though the proposal favours physicalism (everything in the world is made of physical stuff) and its relation to computer science and neural networks, it is important to make some points about these methodologies.

To begin, by looking at the right side of the mind map we can see theories like Machine Functionalism and Computer Science are encapsulated within the general theory of Functionalism, which promotes the notion that, within a Theory of Mind context, the constitution of a mind is not important, only functional equivalence is necessary to create a homologue of mind. This idea is demonstrably false. There have been many attempts to create a general AI using computers based on Van Neumann architecture[5]. While capable of many wonderful things, Van Neumann computers have never achieved any level of general AI (human like intelligence with agency) and it seems now well understood that this strategy will not work[16]. Even if the graveyard of failed computer science projects is not convincing, it is possible to see the fallacy of this strategy using A Priori methods of deduction. Van Neumann computers are computational machines where everything they do boils down to binary math. And since math is only instrumental in nature (useful for predictions), it cannot represent a real homologue of true brain activity. Calculating the trajectory of a thrown ball has nothing to do with a real ball arcing through an Earthly gravity-well. Weather simulations produce no rainfall within a computer’s hardware. Simulations are only indicative of what might be happening, not what is _actually_ happening. Nonetheless, the usefulness of simulations is without a doubt a critical step we must take in order to better understand the problem raised here. Clearly, we have used math to understand in exquisite detail the workings of neurons. A detailed view of this can be found in appendix 1.

So, if math cannot create a conscious homologue, what is the way forward? A possible solution is the Mind-Brain Identity theory. Put forward by U.T. Place[21], this conjecture moves things in the right direction because it states that mental events correlate to physical events in a brain. It seems odd that this premise is a bitter pill to swallow for many, but in support of its critics, the theory provides little to explain the true mechanisms involved.

For that, we utilize a more modern theory proposed by Koch, namely his proposed Neural Correlates of Consciousness (NCC) which states that there exists a minimal set of neurons sufficient to explain a conscious percept[22, 23]. NCC relies heavily on neuronal dynamics (see Appendix 1) to support the overall theory. Neuronal dynamics will certainly be used by simulation software to explore possible NCCs within the brain of _Drosophila_. But this begs the question: which particular neurons represent a NCC and where are they located in the brain. Koch himself has various thoughts on this but to keep things simple, his arguments lean towards the cortex. More importantly, he also asserts that the subcortex (i.e. midbrain in humans) is insufficient to explain consciousness[23].

While the proposal strongly agrees with the notion of NCC, it does not agree with Koch’s latter premise and instead promotes the idea that the subcortex is in fact, the source of affects and their foundational role in manifesting subjective experience. This distinction between cortex and subcortex is not a trivial matter. To understand its importance, the final explananda can now be addressed.

**Where is seek located in the brain?**

At the beginning of this section on the Design of Study, it was stated that to understand the proposal’s theories and associated design methodologies, we would start with a basic form of the problem (i.e. Consciousness ), and then look at supporting theories and methodologies as we move toward the more precise question: can it be demonstrated that affects such as “seek” are the root of phenomenal consciousness and can it be shown that such NCCs (neural circuits) reside within the central complex of _Drosophila melanogaster_? Now that many of the explananda have been addressed, it’s time to look at the final explananda, “Where is seek/consciousness located in the brain?”

This area of the mind-map leads us down the path of Neurophysiology. Psychiatry and its associated branches are not favoured by the proposal at this time. However, within this general domain, two very important theoretical frameworks do emerge, Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience. The primary difference between the two is driven respectively by neuroscience of the cortex versus that of the subcortex regions of the brain. In humans, subcortical regions are located in the midbrain, and in _Drosophila_ the homologue would be the central complex (CX). This bifurcation of cortex and subcortex is a very important distinction and is explained in exquisite detail by Panksepp and Solms[24]. Their arguments say the following. Cognitive Neuroscience assumes that consciousness must necessarily supervene on brain processes in the cortex, while Affective Neuroscience takes the position that consciousness supervenes on the midbrain (in humans). Damasio supports the latter[7] along with Panksepp and Solms. They have all come to view the foundations of consciousness as an organism’s homeostatic control of using affects. Furthering these theories are the Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) studies by Panksepp[25, 26]. Not only are affects foundational but the seek affect, in particular, appears to mediate the primary process of phenomenology[25]. This possibility is central to the proposal.

One might presume that the evidence presented by researchers on both sides would bring about clarity, but alas this is not so simple. Methodologies on both sides differ wildly and make it hard to compare results. If one looks at the mind-map above Neurophysiology, you find two branching sets of methodologies. With regard to Cognitive Neuroscience, experiments and evidence stem mostly from human studies using fMRI images. While on the Affective side, animal experiments employ invasive methods and allow for DBS or surgical procedures that remove select areas of the brain. The latter is unthinkable to perform on humans. On the other hand, human studies use natural communication with subjects whereas animal studies have to rely on non-language observations to determine changes in the organism’s mental state. Because these methods greatly differ, it is difficult to make comparisons. The differences in methods often lead to heavy criticism being laid against both sides.

So what position does the proposal take in this regard? The research methodologies presented by Solms and Panksepp seem the most convincing and lead to Affective Neuroscience and an investigation of the CX. This position relies on the following key points:

1.       Animal models of neural dynamics are useful and present a reasonable homologue to humans.

2.       A Neural Correlate of Consciousness exists but its location has yet to be discovered.

3.       Affects (i.e. feelings) represent the foundations of consciousness.

4.       There are seven affects in animals and of these, the Seek Affects seems promising as the core of phenomenal consciousness.

5.       Affects reside in the midbrain of humans and accordingly should be in the CX of _Drosophila_.

It is for all of the above key points that the design methods of the proposal will concentrate on locating affects in the CX of _Drosophila_ using the Fruit Fly Brain Observatory’s FlybrainLab software. It is well suited to explore neural circuits but how this is done in detail is described in Appendix 2 and 3.

In summary everything above, the research problem addressed in this proposal is to model and localize seek affects within the brain of the fruit fly. The approach for solving this problem is to use neurophysiology and computational neuroscience to show a clear neuromechanistic circuit model using simulation tools available from the FFBO. The novelty and significance of this approach is to use a model organism to shed light on how to achieve Artificial General Intelligence.

**Appendix 1 – Mathematics**

Common tools for the study of neuronal dynamics are mathematical models based on the seminal work of Hodgkin and Huxley, who published the first widely accepted paper providing a mechanistic explanation of the action potential within neurons. Since their discovery, many more models have been published. The Thesis will without a doubt employ these models within the FFBO platform and its associated FlybrainLab software. Nonetheless, it will be necessary to explain the underpinnings of functional simulations employed within the FlybrainLab software. To this end, a brief overview of neuronal mathematical models is presented below.

Leaky Integrate-And-Fire Models

Understanding this model begins with a definition for the Postsynaptic Potential of neurons (PSP). The PSP describes the difference in potential between the interior and exterior of the neuronal cell membrane and can be expressed mathematically using the following equation.

Where ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image012.gif) represents the voltage of neuron ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image014.gif) at a specific point in time and ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image016.gif) represents a neurons resting potential given that no incoming spikes are received. The difference of ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image018.gif) defines the Postsynaptic Potential over a particular time course of action potentials that take place between two neurons ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image020.gif)and ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image022.gif).  ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image024.gif) is thus defined in this manner and represents the resulting excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP).

![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image026.gif)

Figure 1. The diagram depicts two neurons, ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image028.gif)and ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image030.gif)  both which send spike chains toward the postsynaptic, neuron ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image014.gif). As each incoming action potential firing time ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image032.gif) , shown on the two horizontal bars below the graph, increases the neuron’s potential above the ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image016.gif). We show here that the voltage moves upward toward a threshold potential ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image034.gif). Once the threshold is breached at ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image036.gif) neuron ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image014.gif) triggers an action potential, ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image024.gif), which accordingly projects downstream.

Important to note in Figure 1 is the additive effect of each spike potential as it arrives at the postsynaptic neuron ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image014.gif). The spike trains from both neurons, ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image028.gif)and ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image030.gif) causes an increasing Excitatory Post Synaptic Potential (EPSP), and with the increasing potential there will be a point where ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image012.gif) crosses a threshold potential denoted by ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image034.gif).

The EPSP time course is formalized as ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image038.gif), and represents the spike train interval over which the PSPs deflect the potential away from ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image016.gif). Accordingly, an action potential will eventually hit threshold ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image034.gif), triggering an action potential in neuron ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image014.gif) that will propagate down the axon. Once fired, ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image012.gif) quickly drops and will eventually return to ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image016.gif).

Using the above, one can calculate a postsynaptic potential at a particular point in time to be the sum of all PSPs. The following equation represents this sum, but it is important to note that summation is only an estimate of the true value.

![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image040.gif)

The true behaviour of neurons is not so simple. The potential will only increase in a linear fashion, as described above, when a small number of incoming PSPs arrive at the receiving dendrites. When many PSPs deflect the resting potential of a neuron, its behaviour is non-linear and drives the potential of the neuron up to its threshold of about 20-30mV, which then allows the potential to spike and peak at about 70-100mV.

![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image042.gif)

  
With the above definition of potential, it is now possible to determine how a current will propagate along a neuron. This can be demonstrated using a standard resistor-capacitor circuit

Figure 2. A simple RC circuit with a single resistor, ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image044.gif), a single capacitor,![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image046.gif),and an incoming current ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image048.gif).

 Figure 2 represents a typical RC circuit. Using Ohm’s law, we know the following:

![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image050.gif)

Where the voltage ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image052.gif) can be represented in our case as ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image054.gif) , where ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image056.gif) is the voltage across the resistor ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image044.gif) in the circuit above. We can therefore express Ohm’s equation as ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image058.gif).  However, this is incomplete. There are two components of our RC circuit, and the law of current conservation requires that the total current must equal the sum of current across both the resistor and the capacitor. The law of current conservation for the RC circuit in Figure 2 can thus be written as:

![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image060.gif)

Using Ohm’s law above, we can express ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image062.gif) as ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image064.gif) , which lets us rewrite the above equation as:

![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image066.gif)

Further, ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image068.gif) is the current across the capacitor. Capacity can be expressed here as ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image070.gif) where ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image072.gif) is the charge of the capacitor and ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image074.gif) is the voltage across the capacitor. Knowing this we can express ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image068.gif), the current across the capacitor as the differential equation ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image076.gif). Since the charge ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image072.gif) can be further expressed as capacitance multiplied by voltage, we can express charge as ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image078.gif) and thus rewrite ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image080.gif)  as ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image082.gif). Thus ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image084.gif) above can now be expressed as

![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image086.gif)

We must now consider the time constant of the neuron’s membrane. This is done to understand how the potential of a neuron’s membrane either charges or decays over time. The time constant of the membrane can be expressed by the following standard equation:

![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image088.gif)

By multiplying the equation ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image090.gif)    by ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image044.gif), we derive the following:

![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image092.gif)

And because as already shown above, time constant ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image094.gif), we can now rewrite the above as:

![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image096.gif)

Thus we can rewrite the above in a more standard form as:

![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image098.gif)

The above is just a short sample of the maths utilized by many neuronal simulation software. It is expected that these methods will be employed to help simulate activity maps within the FFBO software platform.

**Appendix 2 -** **Neurophysiology**

Within the proposal's context, neurophysiology means creating a neurophysiological computer-based model within the model organism, _Drosophila_. As discussed above, a significant benefit of using Drosophila as the model organism is that because it has been so well studied, there already exist many data repositories that have been published and are open for other researchers to participate. Namely:

•              Fruit Fly Brain Observatory

•              FlyCircuit DB

•              FlyBrain Neuron Database

•              Virtual Fly Brain

•              BrainBase

The proposal will not try to explain each platform and its associated pros and cons. However, the Fruit Fly Brain Observatory (FFBO) seems best suited to the thesis' goals. The FFBO focuses on the general assumption that neurophysiological maps are crucial to formulating hypotheses about what makes up the Fruit Fly's ability to process sensory stimuli [27]. If one equates the seek affect as a fundamental process, then such maps seem appropriate for exploring seek-related circuits.

Neurophysiological maps can be generated using the FlybrainLab application's natural query language. For example, in Figure 2) below is the construction of all GABAergic neurons within the Fanshaped Body, a central Neuropil within the Fruit Fly Central Complex.

![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image099.gif)![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image101.gif)![A picture containing decorated

Figure 2 – Two neurophysiological maps generated by the FFBO. On the left a lateral view of local GABAergic neurons that make up the Fanshaped Body (FB). Image B on the right is an anterior view of this same neurophysiological map. This can be recreated by going to the following link: [https://neuronlp.adult.fruitflybrain.org/](https://neuronlp.adult.fruitflybrain.org/) and entering the query "show local GABAergic neurons within FB".

Initial tests of the 'software's ability to trace neuronal pathways innervating from the Medulla to the Fanshaped Body (FB) within the Central Complex (CX) are presented in figure 3.

![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image105.gif)

Figure 3 - Example innervation from the Medulla (MED) to the Central Complex (CX). In total, 6 neuropils are connected: MED-LOB-LP-VLP-DMP-FB.

The above is only a simple trace of neurons using a small data set within the complete Drosophila database within FlybrainLab. Nonetheless, it is a good example of what can be accomplished with FlybrainLab with minimal effort.

However, it is insufficient to look at the synaptome at a macro level. FFBO's FlybrainLab application can identify specific neurons and visually highlight them within a dense cluster of neurons within a neuropil. This is critical as little is still known about neurophysiological circuits at an atomic level. As demonstrated in Figure 4, a single neuron has been selected within the FB from the original query.

Figure 4 – A single neuron, named Gad1-F-100054, has been selected and highlighted on the right. On the left side of the image is relevant data associated with the neuron.

There are other methods to select sets of neurons with the FFBO data set. All these tools provide a suite of methods to identify specific neurophysiological circuits within the synaptome of the central complex within the CNS of _Drosophila_. This offers many benefits. Firstly, it allows for the free investigation of cellular mechanisms within the synaptome. However, a detailed understanding of hierarchy organization within the Central Complex of Drosophila is still insufficient. Therefore, it will be necessary to explore the structures that can uncover the feedforward (FF) and feedback (FB) processes that are expected to exist based on a modern understanding of neural networks within the CNS of most organisms[28]. The FlybrainLab tools seem ideally suited to this task.

By way of example, one can demonstrate a more granular view of FF and FB processes by leveraging research that may not, in itself, be granular. For instance, take Figure 5, a diagram presented by Shih regarding the high level of information flow between three primary sensory modalities: visual, auditory and olfactory[29].

![Diagram
Description automatically generated](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image109.gif)

Figure 5 – Shih's diagram of Information  flow between neuropils of Drosophila. Here information is shown as stimulation between three significant modalities of sensory input. Particular focus is on the Pre-Motor group, which contains the FB, a central neuropil hypothesized to be the source of arousal. [29].

Shih's diagram has a great deal of information. Still, it is primarily focused on the Rich Club of loops formed between various modalities and the primary inputs and outputs of the intra-modular motor group (region surrounded by the dotted square). Additionally, Shih's data set is based on thousands of neurons, whereas the proposal aims to demonstrate neuromechanistic circuits with a smaller, tractable subset of neurons. Nonetheless, Shih's analysis of various Rich Clubs is leveraged to guide further study. For example, granular exploration of neuronal structure connecting the pre-motor neuropils such as the FB and Inferior Dorsofrontal Protocerebrum (IDFP) can be achieved by applying neuronal tracing techniques within FlybrainLab. Figure 6 below is one such example.

IDFP IDFP ![](file:///C:/Users/hanna/AppData/Local/Packages/oice_16_974fa576_32c1d314_1b3a/AC/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image113.gif)Figure 6 – Showing a small subset of GABAergic (red) and Cholinergic (yellow) neurons that innervate between the Fanshaped Body and the pre-motor Intra-Dorsal-Frontal-Protocerebrum (IDFP). The anterior view A on the left shows strong connections between FB-IDFP, while the lateral view C exposes strong connections between PB-FB-IDFP. See Appendix 2 for a list of the neurons selected.

By taking Shih's work as a guide, it is possible to select a small number of neurons that connect the FB and the IDFP. This smaller selection makes further tracing possible by searching for postsynaptic neurons with more than, as example, 30 synapses. The higher synapse count ensures that more strongly connected neurons are traced. The result is a particular pathway that seems to be a subset of the FB-IDFP as documented by Shih. This community of neurons can be shown to exist in a visual context and more objectively as a graph. See Figure 7 below.

![Radar chart

Figure 7 – Graph of the neurons community selected as part neurons that innervate between the Fanshaped Body and the pre-motor Intra-Dorsal-Frontal-Protocerebrum (IDFP).

The graph only indicates the existence of a community of neurons, without the direction of information flow. Interestingly, the relations between presynaptic and postsynaptic relations and the weights of these connections can be seen by closer analysis of Appendix 2. Enhancing the graph would be an analysis that still needs to be completed. This is expected in later versions of the proposal.

Beyond just confirmation of Shih's analysis, what is also interesting is to uncover new insights where possible. For example, while the trace within the FlybrainLab did successfully confirm strong connections between the FB-IDFP pathway, another connection to the Protocerebral Bridge (PB) was uncovered. This can be seen by looking at the lateral view C on the right side in Figure 6. Going back to the figure 5 by Shih, one sees no indication of BP connectivity as part of the pre-motor group. This is interesting because it demonstrates that with a more refined view of circuits, it may be possible to uncover new synaptic pathways that, presumably, remain hidden when looking at Rich Groups at a more macro scale.

All the above highlights the benefits of leveraging the results of other researchers as a guide to a more detailed analysis of individual groups of neurons and their associated functions. The goal of all this is to identify a homologue of seek affects within the CX that can be translated into clear circuits that can be tested for evidence of the phenomenal experience based on FEP. This is not the say that finding a homologue of seek is a simple matter. There is still a great deal of mystery about the location of affects and their neuromechanistic underpinnings. The discovery process will require experimentation using various research methods and deep analysis using tools like those found in the FFBO. Over time these tools can tease apart the inner structures of the _Drosophila_ CX and shed light on the nature of affects.

**Appendix 3**

**Computational Affective Neuroscience –** Within the proposal, computational biology simulation will demonstrate a working circuit within the Drosophila brain models. The basic breakdown of the work until this point will be to A) Take the Neurophysiological Models that represent a neural correlate of seek, B) Create executable circuits (i.e. activity maps) that allow computational exploration of functional behaviour, and C) Use activity maps to determine if executed simulations correlate with existing neurophysiological data(see figure 8).

Figure 8 -Progression of exploration from connectome/synapdome to Logical Circuits to Activity Maps from the FFBO.

However, if one might ask why the FlybrainLab software was chosen as a central platform to perform the research in question, other potential contenders are worth mentioning. There are in fact, five additional platforms that could be leveraged within the proposal: NEURON[30], NEST[31], Brian[32], Nengo[33], and DynaSim[34]. Of all of these, Nengo is a strong second contender. Nengo is a general tool for simulating any brain model and can be used to analyze specific circuits in real-time. However, Nengo lacks databases for model organism connectomes and is not well suited for deep exploration of Drosophila neurophysiology.

Regarding a deeper understanding of the FlybrainLab platform, the following components will be reviewed, and certain parts will be expanded upon in future versions of the proposal. Even though not fully decided, more emphasis will be placed on the application NeuroGraph, a specific component of FlybrainLab. This part of the platform is used to apply algorithms (i.e., Louvain) useful for community detection within the _Drosophila_ synaptome. Applying such algorithms to the CX of _Drosophila_, it is the proposal's aim to make clear the CX's internal structure and determine if strong candidates for the Seeking system can be located.

¡  Force-directed layout for the architecture-level graph of the whole brain or circuit-level graph of circuits specified by NeuroSynapsis,

¡  Semi-automated generation of 2D circuit diagrams from specified connectome datasets either at single-neuron or cell-type scale by separating circuit components into input, local and output populations for circuit diagram layouts.

All the above represents a rich suite of tools implemented from any computer using either the locally installed version of FlyBrainLab or the cloud version available on AWS. At this point, FlybrainLab is the lead candidate and offers two implementation methods. The first is by using the Web-based version (BrainMapsViz) of the software, which can be freely accessed at [https://neuronlp.fruitflybrain.org/](https://neuronlp.fruitflybrain.org/). The second way to access the software is via Docker containers that can be run on a local computer or in the AWS cloud using an image provided by the developers.

And while it is not possible to understand all aspects of affects and their relation to phenomenal consciousness, using _Drosophila_ models within the proposal should, at a minimum, provide the following:

1.       A clear understanding of targeted neuropils such as the Central Complex CX and their associated substructures (see Figure 2).

2.       Features to make clear brain circuits and pathways between neurons and provide an interface for accessing neurophysiological data.

3.       Allow decomposition of circuits into functional modules whose input-output relationships can be individually analysed

4.       A way to compare simulated circuits (i.e., activity maps) to physiological data such as Patch Clamp Local Field Potential (pcLFP) data sets of Drosophila melanogaster responding to stimuli that invoke affective behaviour.

Noteworthy is the relevance to existing data sets of pcLFP. The proposal's optional goal is not to generate such data, as it requires very specialized equipment and labs set up for biological research. Instead, it is proposed to use the proposal to leverage the output of various laboratories to help construct a surrogate model of the seek system in _Drosophila_. In effect, this is where we can begin to see "what" the seek neural correlate is and then explore "how" such a model works from a functional perspective. An example of this can be seen in Figure 9.

Like the neurophysiological model of the previous phase, it will be essential to demonstrate that the model provides similar inputs and outputs to available physiological data from in-vivo pcLFP recordings.

As mentioned above, many labs are working on such data. Below is a sample of data from Van Swinderen's laboratory[35] investigating neural correlates of perception by recording local field potentials from the brains of _Drosophila melanogaster_ as they responded to the presentation of visual stimuli such as a vertical bar (see Figure 10).

Figure 10 – Recorded local field potentials by Swinderen & Greenspan[35]. These signals come from the brains of Drosophila melanogaster as it responds to the presentation of visual stimuli: A vertical bar.

The above graph highlights how power increased in the 20-30 Hz range when visual stimuli are presented directly in the centre of a fly's field of view using specialized apparatus (Figure 11 below). This particular behaviour and neurophysiological output are considered central to the proposal and will be exploited as a simple means to engender attention, and by association, its relation to the seek affect.

The association between attention and seek is not speculation, and there is evidence to support this idea. Panksepp found a strong correlation between seek and neuronal circuits active while dreaming[2]. This finding is important. It allows one to deduce that since dreaming, attention, and seek are all hypothesized to use the same neurophysiological system[2], wakeful salience (in the 20-30 Hz range) provides evidence of seek.

Thus, while it cannot be proven at this time, the seek affect is either a cause of salience or strongly correlated with it. If the proposal can accommodate the effort, it hopes to provide evidence of this link by using a two-step process. First, by gathering LFP recordings from a circuit within the CX. And secondly, by using these LFP data sets to guide the construction of circuit models that, in turn, lead to activity maps. Such maps, as discussed above, would then provide an ideal neuromechanistic means to compare simulations against LFP in-vivo data of salience. This methodology is important to the theis but is not a necessary part of the proposal. At whatever stage it can be accomplished, these comparisons over time will lead to objective explanations of seek and salience and further provide compelling evidence of this system's role within consciousness.
