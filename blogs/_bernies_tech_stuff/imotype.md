# Imotype

ImoType is a pure JavaScript typing game that I created with the help of this YouTube tutorial. I decided to use songs that I enjoy and embedded the Spotify widget for each corresponding song. Users are notified when their caps lock is on. In the future, I wish to add Google login functionality and a scoreboard so that users can log in to their accounts and compete against their friends.

While I didn't necessarily learn anything new through doing this project, it helped me become more comfortable with coding, and it was a fun project that I could add to my GitHub.
