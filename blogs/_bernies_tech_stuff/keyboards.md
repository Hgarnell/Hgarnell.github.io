# Keyboards!

## Current Builds

#### Yunzii (Budget and 1st Build)
Keyboard: [YUNZII KC84S  Milk Honey](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099RJ743P/ref=twister_B099RFPY6M?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)
Switches: [Gazzew Boba U4T ](https://swagkeys.com/products/gazzew-u4t-boba-switches)
Total cost: $110 (USD)

	 - I chose the Yunzii kc84 as my base keyboard because came really nice stock and was super affordable.
	 - I wanted something bluetooth that I would be able to take to university with me, and also really liked the aethetics of the board with its high frame.
	 - The RGB's where pretty shnazzy, and I really liked the  pbt keycaps that it came with.
	 - I orginally was planning to put in the anubis switches as I was really into **THOCK**, but they were sold out everywhere, and only available overseas unless i wanted to pay 50$ in shipping costs
	 - I went with the Boba U4ts instead as they were also pretty thocky but mainly the name was cute

### Keychron Q1 (Current Build)
Keyboard: [Keychron Q1 Barebones Carbon Black w/ Knob ](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=8841)
Switches: [TTC Blue-ish White Switch - Tactile - Plate Mount](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=7921)
Keycaps:[Shurikey ABS Double Shot Keycap Set )](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=8631)

	- The one thing I regret with this build is the keycaps. I really wish that the MK tech center would have put prices on the merchandise as I probably wouldnt have picked these if I had known they were 69 DOLLARS? AND ABS? admittedly my own fault for not asking.\
	- I spent around 20 minutes jsut pressing different switches, the red bean tacticle switches really caught my eye but, the TTc blueish's just kinda, stuck with me. I also quickly realizsed I hate linear switches much more than I thought I would.
	- The weight and feel of the Keychron is amazing, While, I would've prefered a brown rather than the black that I have at the moment I still love the aethetics. AND THE KNOB IT HAS A KNOB
	- The RGB's of the board arn't as impressive as the ones on my Yunzii but, I like the fact that its easiy programmably, I just cant be bothered at this moment.


I got really into keyboards last december while working as an intern. My mentor had this amazing Akko keyboard, which if I can recall correctly, was the Blue Samurai colorway? Which not only looked amazing but sounded absolutely amazing too. 
I had already known about Akko through tiktok where I saw their matcha and cinnamonroll keyboards and absolutely fell in love.

The co-worker whos desk I borrowed, happend to leave their  Leopold number pad with topre switches on his desk, and when my mentor showed us that, I was then introduced to an entirely new world of switches, rather than just the general cherry mx ones.

 I think I spent everynight that week watching switch testing youtube videos, keyboard reviews, and keycap unboxings, and quicly got my hands on a hotswappable mechanical keyboard.

While visting Arizona this year (2022), one of the things I was most looking foward to was visiting the MechanicalKeyboards.com warehouse! It was everything I could have dreamed for + more. And there, with the help of the store staff, I put together my second keyboard. While not my endgame, (bongo cat keyboard, I am looking at you) I love it to bits aswell.
