# Cinnamon Rolls
*Makes 12 extremely large cinnamon rolls*
Self proclaimed by my dad as the "best cinnamon rolls" and they are vegan! *bonus points right?* 

I adapted the dough from [Tasty's Cinnamon  Rolls](https://tasty.co/recipe/tasty-101-cinnamon-rolls)and then followed some of the guidence from [Pancake Princess's](https://www.thepancakeprincess.com/2018/12/11/best-cinnamon-roll-bake-off/) cinnamon roll bake off to create the filling and also just winged it. 

## Ingredients
#### Tangzhong
	-	65g  All purpose flour
	- 240 mL milk of choice (Soy works best)

#### Dough
	- Tangzhong^
	- 80g sugar
	- 110g unsalted butter of choice, melted (I use miyokos or violife)
	- 565g All purpose flour
	- 300 mL milk
	- 2 tbsp potato starch
	- 2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast
	- 2 tsp salt

#### Filling
	- 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
	- 1 1/2 tbsp cinnamon
	-  1 tsp nutmeg
	-  1/2 tso salt
	- 2 tbsp softened butter

#### Frosting
	 - 115g cream cheese (I use miyokos)
	 - 3 tbsp butter
	 - 1 tbsp rum or sweet whiskey
	 - 1/2 cup powdered sugar

#### "Egg" wash
	- 1 1/2 tbsp maple syrup or honey (any sugar is fine, you just need it to dissolve)
	- 2 tsp butter or fat
	- 2 tbsp milk

## Prep
#### Making the Tangzhong
1.  If making in the microwave, combine the 65g of flour and 240ml of milk in a microwave safe bowl, if making on the stove top, do the same in a pot
2. Microwave in 15 second intervals, mixing thoroughly , for stove top heat on medium heat and whisk constantly.
3. Continue microwaving or whisking until the mixture is a mashed potato consistency, thick but not too thick. Its okay to have some lumps.
4. Cover with plastic wrap to avoid creating a skin and put in the fridge to cool completely

#### Making the dough
1.  In a microwave safe bowl, melt the butter and add the cold milk. Let it sit to the side until it is luke warm.
2. In a stand mixer, add the flour, potato startch, salt,  and sugar and mix slowly to combine.
3. Once the dry mix looks combined, add the tangzhong and begin to mix, slowly add the milk until you get a sticky wet dough. If it looks too wet, thats okay.
4.  Continue kneading until you get to the window pane ** stage, this will take a while.
5. Once kneaded, lightly butter the top of the dough and cover with plastic wrap. Let sit for an hour or 30 minutes if you are in a warm climate.
6. While waiting for the dough to rise, I recommended lining some baking tins with parchment paper or butter and moving on to making the filling and wash.

#### Making the filling
1. In a small bowl mix the sugar, cinnamon, salt and nutmeg together
2. Once combined cream in the butter or fat.

#### Assembly! ( Dough should be doubled)
1. Prep your countertop by either cleaning or also covering it with plastic wrap. Dust lightly with flour.  If you havent prepped your baking pans with grease or parchment do that first.
2. Deflate the risen dough, and bring it into a dough ball, don't knead it too much though
3. Put the ball on the counter, using a knife, cut a + into the ball and slightly flour. You can skip this step, it just makes rolling the ball out into a rectangle easier
4. You want to make the rectangle quite big, it should be around 1.25ft in height and 3ft in width.
5. You'll want to check that you have enough flour on the bottom of the dough to prevet sticking, so continue flouring and lifting up the dough as you roll it out
6. Once rolled out, spread the filling mixture evenly all across the roll, reaching all ends. Sprinkle on more cinnamon at the end if you like
7. Begin rolling the dough, you want to keep the scroll as tight as possible, pulling back on the roll before you push forward. You hands will get messy, but its worth it
8. Using butchers twine or unflavored floss,  go underneath the log and pinch off 1  1/2 ish inch pieces.
9. Place the cinnamon rolls into your baking pans, You want them to be around 1 inch apart.
10. Cover TIGHLY with plastic wrap AND foil and let them rise overnight in the fridge.

#### Baking
1. In the morning take the cinnamon rolls out of the fridge and let them come to room temperature.
2. Preheat the oven to 350 F or 175 C convection.
3. As your oven and cinnamon rolls are coming to temperature, mix together the "egg" wash.
4. Put the rolls in the oven once they are room temperature and the oven is preheated.
5.  Bake for around 20 minutes (Make the frosting now!), then take them out of the oven and quickly brush on the egg wash.
6. Place them back in the oven,, repeat this step until the cinnamon rolls have a beautiful golden brown finish. 
7. Take the rolls out of the oven and let cool for atleast 10 minutes, 45 if possible!

#### Frosting
1. Not much to it, just mix all the frosting ingredients together.
2. Either pipe it on in stripes once the cinnamon rolls cool before serving, or spread on immediately after they are out of the oven.

## Notes
- Windowpane stage is when you can pull on the dough and it doesnt rip. You should be able to stretch it apart so that the dough forms an almost translucent pane.
