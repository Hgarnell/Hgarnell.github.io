# Jaga-Jaga じゃがじゃが
*serves* 5 as a side
My families take on the japanese dish "Niku-Jaga" 肉じゃが as we dont use meat. Niku stands for meat and jaga is short for "Jagaimo" which means white potato. This is a common side dish you will seen eaten in most Japanese households. SImple ingredients, but packed with flavour. You might be shocked by the amount of onions, but they contribute to the sweetness of the dish, and go incredibily well with rice.

## Ingredients
	- 2 carrots
	- 4 potatoes
	- 4 onions
	- 5 tbsp soy sauce
	- 4 tbsp sweetner of choice
	- 1 tbsp *

## Prep
1. cut the potato, carrots, and onion into bite sized pieces.
2. Stir fry onion on medium heat in a pot for two minutes with some water to prevent sticking. You want a pot big enough to hold all the ingredients.
3. Add the rest of the ingredients into the pot and mix.
4. Put lid on the pot and continue cooking on medium heat for 15 minutes
5. Stir and close the lid, cook for another 10 minutes or until the potatoes are cooked through.

## Notes
* *mentsuyu is a noodle dipping sauce which is basically a infused soysauce with dashi (broth), mirin and sake. You can dillute it with water to make a quick soup, or even use it as a seasoning as I do in this recipe. you can easily buy it at your local asian supermarket, [amazon](https://amazon.com) or even make it yourself!*
