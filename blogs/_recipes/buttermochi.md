# Hawaiian Butter Mochi, without butter
*9x9 baking pan, serves arouund 18*
Butter mochi was one of my favourite childhood desserts, unfortunately my mom stopped making it once she went vegan and when I went vegan as well, i thought I'd never be abkle to eat it again. While I eventually did find and start making a vegan recipe, it was never the same. It was always a bit too chewy and gooey, still delicious but not the same as the one I grew up eating. When trying to clean out our pantry I had the idea of mixing my  normal recipe with the left-over risotto rice we had lying around, and to my suprise, the extra starchyness in the arrborio rice made the perfect combination! I like to mix in miso and rum for the extra oumph, but feel free to leave them both out. Sprinkling sugar on top creates a beautiful crackily crust reminiscent of brownies!

## Ingredients
	- 225 Grams arrborio rice
    - 1 can of coconut cream
    - 225 glutinous rice flour
    - 1 cup sugar + more sugar for sprinkling on top
    - 1 tsp baking soda
    - 1 tbsp custard powder
    - 1 generous splash of rum
    - 1 tbsp miso paste
	

## Pre-Prep
1. Wash the Arrborio rice until water is no longer murky, and soak overnight in the can of coconut cream.
2. Fill the now empty can of coconut cream with hot/boiling water to melt off the excess cream and add to the arrborio rice.

## Prep
1. Preheat the oven to 350 F or 175 C
2. Add in the sugar, glutinous rice flour, baking soda, custard powder, rum and miso to the bowl of soaked rice
3. Blend with immersion blender until smooth, grits are okay, its up to personal preference.
4. Line a baking tray with baking paper.
5. Pour in the batter
6. Sprinkle the top with a even layer of sugar
7. Bake for 1 hour, cover if getting too brown.
8. Let cool completely, atleast 1 hour before slicing

## Notes
- Feel free to add in toppings or mix ins. One of my favorites is Anko, or adzuki bean paste. Peanuts also work well, and so do chocolate chips! If using dried fruit I reconmmend soaking them before hand.
- I also love adding in either black cocoa powder to make oreo mochi bars or Kinako powder (roasted soybean powder). I am sure Black sesame would be delicous too.
