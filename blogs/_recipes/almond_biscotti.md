# My biscotti/sugar cookie recipe
*serves idk*
In Highschool I had a small, and I mean very small, side hussle called Crumb Bunny. I sold cookies to the ASB data centers cafe, "The Hard Drive Cafe". I began selling these with my moms [Peanut Butter Bars](/blogs/_recipes/Peanut_Butter_Bar.md) and they were a hit! I had plans to scale, but then Covid hit, and the profit margins compared to the amount of time I was investing into it were not worth it. But, I digress, this recipe is extremely versatile and can be used to make biscotti like cookies or chewy sugar cookies. You can replace the nut flour with any nut, or seed like sunflower seed flour to keep it allergy friendly. 
## Ingredients
	- 55g Sugar
    - 190 g almond flour
    - 17 g tapioca starch
    - 2 tsp baking powder
    - 1/3 tsp salt
    + water as needed

## Prep
1. cpreheat oven to 350 f or 175 c
2. Mix all dry ingredients togehter
3. add a tablespoon of water at a time until the dough comes together
4. shape into a log if baking biscotti or roll and shape into cookies
5. Bake for 19-23 minutes or until golden brown
## Directions for Biscotti
6. After baking let it cool in the fridge/ freezer and then cut into slices
7. Bake at 250 f or 140 c for 10 mins  and flipping and baking until brown on each side!

## Notes
- Add ins! Adding in coffee grounds is my absolute favourite. I usually do around 1 -2 tbsp depending on how fine the ground is. 
- Mess around with it and measure with your heart.
