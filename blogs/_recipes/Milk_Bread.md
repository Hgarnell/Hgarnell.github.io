# Milk Bread
*Makes 2 large loaves?*
This is my vegan milk bread recipe that I use as a base dough for most of my breads. It has a 75% hydration and makes a lot of bread, I generally like to do an overnight rest before baking however, it is not necessary. Another Variation I like to do is to replace 200g of the milk with canned pineapple juice to make "hawaiian rolls"

## Ingredients
#### Tangzhong
	- 40g Flour
	- 200g milk
#### Bread
	 - Cooled Tangzhong
	 - 650g bread flour
	 - 50g sugar
	 - 7g yeast (2 tsp)
	 - 320g milk
	 - 1 tsp salt
#### Glaze
	- 10g butter or fat
	- 2 tbsp milk
	- 1 tbsp sugar/maple syrup

## Prep
#### Making the Tangzhong
1.  If making in the microwave, combine the 65g of flour and 240ml of milk in a microwave safe bowl, if making on the stove top, do the same in a pot
2. Microwave in 15 second intervals, mixing thoroughly , for stove top heat on medium heat and whisk constantly.
3. Continue microwaving or whisking until the mixture is a mashed potato consistency, thick but not too thick. Its okay to have some lumps.
4. Cover with plastic wrap to avoid creating a skin and put in the fridge to cool completely

#### Making the dough
1.  In a microwave safe bowl, melt the butter and add the cold milk. Let it sit to the side until it is luke warm.
2. In a stand mixer, add the flour, potato startch, salt,  and sugar and mix slowly to combine.
3. Once the dry mix looks combined, add the tangzhong and begin to mix, slowly add the milk until you get a sticky wet dough. If it looks too wet, thats okay.
4.  Continue kneading until you get to the window pane ** stage, this will take a while.
5. Once kneaded, lightly butter the top of the dough and cover with plastic wrap. Let sit for an hour or 30 minutes if you are in a warm climate.
6. While waiting for the dough to rise, I recommended lining some baking tins with parchment paper or butter.
7. Once the odugh is risen, punch down the dough and shape.
8. lightly butter or grease the shaped dough and cover with plastic wrap and place in fridge if letting it rise over night or let is sit out for 2 hours or until doubled in size
9. If rising over night, let it sit at room temperature for an hour or so before baking.
10. Preheat oven to 175 degrees celcius or 350 degrees farenight
11. Bake for 20 mins and then brush on the glaze before baking for another 10 minutes or until golden
