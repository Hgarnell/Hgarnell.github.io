# Stewed Kabocha かぼちゃに
*serves 6 as a side*
One of my absolute favourite side dishes that I eat on a weekly basis! Hearty, sweet and creamy from the flesh of the kabocha, I love eating it on its own, or as an accompniment to rice. If i have left over cooking liquid i like to make a sauce for pasta or udon noodles my mashing the liquid with some of the softer pieces of kabocha. 

## Ingredients
	- 1/2 kabocha squash
	- 2 tbsp mirin
	- 2 tbsp soy sauce
	- 2 tbsp sugar
	- 200 mL water

## Prep
1. Cut the Kabocha into large pieces, around 3cmx3cm cubes, or smalller. its up to you!
2. in a pot add all the ingrdients besides the kabocha, and bring to a boil on high heat.
3. Once boiling add the kabocha and reduce the heat to medium.
4. Cover the kabocha with aluminum foil with a small hole to vent
5. Continue cooking until the liquid has reduced by a third, checking once every 3 minutes.
