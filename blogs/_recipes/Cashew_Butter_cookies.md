# Cashew Butter Cookies 
*Makes 12 cookies* 

My vegan take on the famous levain cookies. I used the [Pancake Princess's]() levain cookie bake off as a starting point for this recipe. Using her tips, and through looking at the nutritional information and macro ratio from the [winning recipe (bravetart)]() I created a wfpb compliant, gluten free (if using gluten-free certified oat flour)  cookie! 

I chose to use cashew butter in this recipe because of its natural sweetness and somewhat buttery taste. Choosing a different nut or seed butter ( use sun-butter or tahini to make it nut free) may result in a thinner, greasier cookie, so you may want to chill the cookie a bit longer.

I was shocked by the results of these cookies, and adding the nutmeg really added an *omph* to them. The cookie had an ooey gooey  center with a beautiul golden crust that was crisp but had a slight chew.

## Ingredients
	- 250g cashew butter 
	- 1 cup Coconut Nectar
	- 2 tsp salt
	- 250g oat flour
	- 300g chocolate chips
	- 2 tsp sea salt
	- 1 tbsp flaxseed
	- 1 tbsp potato startch
	- 6 tbsp boiling water
	- 1 tsp baking powder
	- 1 heaped tsp baking powder  
	- 1 heaped tsp baking soda  
	- 1 pinch nutmeg
	- 1 tsp rum 
	


## Prep
1.  Cream together the cashew butter and coconut nectar until pale and homogeneous.
2.  Make the "egg" by combining the flaxseed with the 6tbsp boiling water and let sit for a bit.
3. combine the oat flour, salt, potato starch and baking powder in a seperate bowl.
4. add the "egg" and rum to the creamed cashew butter, and then slowly combine  the flour mixture. 
5. Add extra liquid of necessary, dough should come together, and bit kinda soft but able to hold its shape.
6. Let sit in the frige overnight if possible or atleast 30 mins, feel free to freeze at this stage
7.  baking at 350 f /  175 c for 15 mins or until golden brown.
## Notes
- You can use any nut butter in this recipe! I like subsituting with sun-butter to make it nut free and tahini!
- The hot water is neccesary as it helps activate the flaxseed and create a stronger egg like gel.
- Feel free to use vanilla or any other flavouring instead of rum
