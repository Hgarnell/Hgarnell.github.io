# My Mom's Peanut Butter Bar
*makes 9 bars*

This is the recipe for my mom's Peanut Butter Bar, which she used to sell at the ASB datacenter. This Peanut butter bars were extremely popular, and  ginourmous. Originally based of a recipe by Chocolate covered katie, my Mom adapted it to her own tastes  and its morphed into its own thing.  I eventually took over baking the peanut butter bars, converting it into an actual recipe rather than measurements measured by the eye. 

## Ingredients
	- 125g applesauce
	- 420g Peanut Butter (GO CHUNKY OR GO HOME!)
	- 250g sugar
	- 2 tsp sifted baking soda
	- 260g Gluten Free Flour
	- 1/2 tsp salt
	- 5 tsp vanilla essence
	- 1 heaped cup chocolate chips ( more like 2 cups)
	

## Prep
1. Put ingredients into a stand mixer in the same order as listed in the list
2. Preheat oven to 250c / 480 f
3. Mix until combined. It should be crumbly but come together with you squeeze it. Make sure to scrape the sides and bottom if neccesary
4. Put into a lined baking pan (9X9) and press so its packed
5. Bake at 160c for 15 minutes
6. Cover with foil and lower the temperature to 145c for 45 minutes.

## Notes
- We use edmunds gluten free all purpose flour. More flour might be needed if necessary
- These Peanut butter bars are HUGE. While this recipe makes "9" servings, 1 serving will likely be enough for 4 people.
