# Lemon Poppy Seed Muffins
*serves 7*

Using [Pancake Princess’s](https://www.thepancakeprincess.com/2020/05/19/best-blueberry-muffin-bake-off/) blueberry muffin bake-off as my inspiration, I loved the look of  [Hummingbird High’s](https://www.hummingbirdhigh.com/2019/08/levain-bakery-blueberry-muffins.html)muffins. So I decided to use her recipe as my starting point, veganized it and then used the reverse creaming technique for a tighter crumb and softer structure. I also took some tips from [Yammie’s Noshery’s](https://www.yammiesnoshery.com/2019/08/the-best-lemon-poppyseed-muffins.html) blog ( who came first in the lemon poppyseed muffin bake-off!) and used four lemons, yes 4 for their zest!
 
## Ingredients
	- 255g all purpose flour
	- 50g almond flour
	- 2 tsp baking powder
	- 1/2 tsp salt
	- 2 tbsp custard powder
	- 198g sugar
	- 113 room temperature vegan butter
	- 113g soy yogurt
	- 100g water
	- 2 tbsp lemon juice
	- 2 tbsp poppy seeds
	- Zest of 4 lemons
	
## Lemon Icing
	- 1 cup powdered sugar
	- 4 tbsp lemon juice
	- 1 tsp rums


## Prep
1. combine the sugar and lemon zest, rubbing the two together to work in the lemon oils fully. The sugar should become slightly macerated.
2. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, almond flour, baking powder, salt, poppy seeds and custard powder
3. in a stand mixer, beat the butter briefly before adding sugar and creaming until light and fluffy.
4. Once creamed, mix in a third of the flour and combine slowly. Add the remaining mix once combined and mix until it looks like cookie dough
5. mix the yogurt, water and lemon juice.
6. slowly incorporate the wet into the stand mixer on low.
7. Mix until just thoroughly mixed.
8. Let the batter sit in the fridge for at least an hour or overnight.
9. Preheat oven to 200 c or 400f. If baking muffins that have been resting in the fridge, let the batter come to room temperature first.
10. Heavily grease a muffin tin ( I used Cake goop, a 1 to 1.5 mix of flour and vegan butter). But only grease every other muffin hole and its surrounding top area. 
11. Slightly overfill each muffin hole. This will result in super high domed muffins
12. Bake for 15-20 minutes until browned, or a toothpick comes out clean.
13. Let the muffins cool before taking them out of the muffin tin.
14. Make the frosting by mixing the powdered sugar with rum and adding lemon juice until it becomes a viscous consistency.
15. Take the muffins out of the muffin tins and spoon over the glaze once cooled

## Notes
- You can omit the rum from the icing, i just prefer the flavour
- I would advice against using a silicon baking pan as it results in weirdly shaped muiffins?
