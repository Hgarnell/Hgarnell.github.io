# Cashew Butter Cookies 
*Makes 12 cookies* 
My vegan take on the famous levain cookies. I used the [Pancake Princess's]() levain cookie bake off as a starting point for this recipe. Using her tips, and through looking at the nutritional information and macro ratio from the [winning recipe (bravetart)]() I created a wfpb compliant, gluten free (if using gluten-free certified oat flour)  cookie! 

I chose to use cashew butter in this recipe because of its natural sweetness and somewhat buttery taste. Choosing a different nut or seed butter ( use sun-butter or tahini to make it nut free) may result in a thinner, greasier cookie, so you may want to chill the cookie a bit longer.

I was shocked by the results of these cookies, and adding the nutmeg really added an *omph* to them. The cookie had an ooey gooey  center with a beautiul golden crust that was crisp but had a slight chew.

## Ingredients
	- 250g cashew butter 
	- 1 cup Coconut Nectar
	- 2 tsp salt
	- 250g oat flour
	- 300g chocolate chips
	- 2 tsp sea salt
	- 1 tbsp flaxseed
	- 1 tbsp potato startch
	- 6 tbsp boiling water
	


## Prep
1. cut the potato, carrots, and onion into bite sized pieces.
2. 
## Notes
- You can use any nut butter in this recipe! I like subsituting with sun-butter to make it nut free and tahini!
