Hi! I'm Bernie, and this website was my idea :) To be frank, I got sick of the old wordpress site, and also got a bit greedy, wanting something with my name on it. 
I am currently a university student majoring in Networks and Cybersecurity. Outside of my university work I spend my time learning more about security, baking/cooking or at the gym. You can also find me going on long walks with my dog Phineas.

This space to be a place to blog and showcase myself and my hobbies.
